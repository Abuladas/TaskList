# TaskList
A simple Python program that can manage tasks and organize them, I like to call it "baby SQL.".
*this branch has the GUI file
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This program allows the user to view, add, and remove tasks in a simple command-line interface. The tasks are stored in a list, and the program provides functions: 

1- Viewing the tasks,

2- Adding a task to the list, 

3- Removing a task from the list,

4- Saving a tasks list,

5- Loading a tasks list.

The program also uses a while loop to repeatedly prompt the user for input and perform the appropriate action based on the user's choice.

----------------------------------------------------

Future improvements:

1- adding a due date to the tasks (need to be tailored to each OS (Linux, MacOS, and Windows),

2- Wmailing the lists to an email address,

3-Adding a GUI.
